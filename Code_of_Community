# Code of Community
Effective date: 2025-10-15
Last updated: 2025-10-15

The Litex community is dedicated to a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone. This Code of Community (“Code”) applies to all community spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, events, and any other project-related channels.

This Code is adapted in spirit from the Contributor Covenant.

## Our pledge
We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be open to constructive feedback
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
- Acknowledge and correct mistakes

### Examples of unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, intimidation, or hate speech
- Discriminatory jokes and language
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment, including repeated unwelcome contact
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Sustained disruption of discussions, reviews, or events
- Any conduct that violates applicable laws or infringes others’ rights

## Scope
This Code applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns:
- Contact the maintainers at litexlang@outlook.com
- Optionally include: links, screenshots, message excerpts, timestamps, and any context helpful to assess the situation

We will handle reports with care, confidentiality, and respect. Retaliation against anyone who reports an incident in good faith is not tolerated.

## Enforcement
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. Actions may include, in escalating order where appropriate:
1) Informal coaching or clarification
2) A private warning
3) A temporary ban from community spaces
4) Removal of contributions or privileges (e.g., issue, PR, or review access)
5) A permanent ban in severe or repeated cases
6) Referral to platform administrators or authorities if required by law

Enforcement decisions are at the discretion of community leaders, considering context, severity, and history.

## Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by contacting litexlang@outlook.com with a concise explanation and any relevant evidence.

## Community collaboration norms
- Be explicit and kind in reviews; prefer suggestions over demands.
- Use reproducible examples, clear issue titles, and steps to reproduce.
- Respect maintainers’ time and established workflows (e.g., templates, CI checks).
- Follow repository-specific contributing guidelines and coding standards.

## Attribution
This Code draws inspiration from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

- Email: litexlang@outlook.com
