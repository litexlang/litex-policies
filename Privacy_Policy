Effective date: 2025-10-15
Last updated: 2025-10-15

This Privacy Policy explains how the Litex project (“Litex”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information in connection with:
- The Litex language and related open-source projects
- The Litex website (“Litex Webpage”)
- Litex tools, including but not limited to golitex, pylitex, and the Litex Jupyter Kernel (collectively, the “Tools”)

If you do not agree with this policy, you should not use our website or tools.

Note: This document is a template and not legal advice. Please consult your counsel before adopting it.

## Who we are
- Project: Litex
- Website: https://github.com/litexlang and any related webpage(s)
- Contact: litexlang@outlook.com
- Maintainer/Owner: [LEGAL ENTITY OR MAINTAINER NAME]
- Address: N/A

## Scope
This Policy covers information processed when you:
- Visit or interact with the Litex Webpage
- Use or integrate any Litex Tools (e.g., golitex, pylitex, Litex Jupyter Kernel)
- Contact us or interact with our community spaces (e.g., GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests)

This Policy does not cover third-party websites, services, or integrations that we do not control.

## Information we collect

### 1) Information you provide to us
- Contact information and communications (e.g., when you email us or open an issue)
- Community contributions (e.g., issues, pull requests, discussions, comments, code contributions). These are public on GitHub and include your GitHub username and any content you publish.
- Support or survey responses (if any)

We do not operate an account or login system for the Litex Webpage or Tools at this time.

### 2) Information collected automatically
- Website usage: When you visit the Litex Webpage, standard web logs may capture IP address, user agent, referrer, pages visited, and timestamps. We use this data to operate, secure, and improve the site.
- Cookies and similar technologies: The Litex Webpage may use strictly necessary cookies for basic site functionality. If we use analytics or performance cookies, we will present a notice and obtain consent where required.
- Tool runtime data: By default, the Tools (golitex, pylitex, Litex Jupyter Kernel) do not transmit personal data to us. They may produce local logs on your machine for debugging. If any optional telemetry or “check for updates” feature is introduced, it will be opt-in and documented with controls to disable it.

### 3) Information from third parties
- GitHub and community platforms: If you interact with our GitHub repositories or discussions, we may see your public GitHub profile information and any content you post pursuant to GitHub’s terms and privacy policy.
- Service providers: Hosting, analytics, and CI/CD providers may process limited data to provide their services.

We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or under the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided personal data to us, contact us to request deletion.

## How we use information
- Provide and maintain the Litex Webpage and Tools
- Respond to inquiries, bug reports, and support requests
- Operate and improve open-source projects, including quality, performance, and security
- Analyze usage (website) to understand traffic patterns and improve content (only where permitted and subject to consent where required)
- Enforce our Terms of Use and Code of Community
- Comply with legal obligations

## Legal bases (EEA/UK/Similar jurisdictions)
Where applicable, our processing relies on:
- Performance of a contract or steps to enter into a contract
- Legitimate interests (e.g., operating open-source projects and securing our services)
- Consent (e.g., non-essential cookies/analytics where required)
- Legal obligations

## Sharing of information
We share information only as needed to:
- Service providers and vendors (e.g., hosting, analytics, CI/CD) under appropriate safeguards
- Community platforms (e.g., GitHub) when you choose to publish content there
- Comply with law, legal process, or to protect rights, property, and safety
- Business or project transfers (e.g., project stewardship changes). We will notify you where required by law.

We do not sell personal data.

## Data retention
We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, to comply with legal obligations, and to resolve disputes. Public contributions on GitHub are generally retained indefinitely as part of the project history.

## International data transfers
We may process and store information in countries other than yours. Where applicable, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for cross-border transfers.

## Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data
- Object to or restrict processing
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent
- Lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority

To exercise these rights, contact us at litexlang@outlook.com. We may need to verify your identity to process requests.

## Cookies and controls
- You can adjust browser settings to refuse or limit cookies.
- If we use analytics requiring consent, the Litex Webpage will present controls to accept or decline.
- Disabling cookies may impact site functionality.

## Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no system is completely secure.

## Third-party links
The Litex Webpage and documentation may link to third-party sites or services. We are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.

## Open-source transparency
- Content you publish in Litex repositories (issues, PRs, code, comments) is public and may be indexed by search engines.
- Contribution history may be preserved via forks and mirrors outside our control.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date indicates the latest revision. Material changes will be communicated via the Litex Webpage or repository notices where feasible.
